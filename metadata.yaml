description: Within recent years fairly exhaustive studies have been made on many
  aspects on American Science and Technology. To make a comprehensive study of American
  scientific instruments and instrument makers in the American Colonies is no simple
  matter, partly because of an indifference to the subject in the past, and partly
  because of the great volume of sources that must be sifted to accomplish it.
